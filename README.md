# Jotter
A quick note taking application for those who store useful data you need to get at a later time. 

Jotter is an application *currently under development*. This isn't even alpha yet, more prototype as I am learning WPF. The functionality is very limited at the moment. 

The idea:

- Clean look
- Very easy to use
- easy to use back-end database or user friendly data.
- aimed at adding notes somewhere that can be easily brought back up when needed.
- ability to _export_ the notes to a text file, markdown, html, etc. 
- a settings area to customize the application and its  functionality.
